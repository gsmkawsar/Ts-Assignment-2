## **The technology that I used**

### **Node.js**  
🚀 Node.js is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside the browser. It enables building scalable, high-performance server-side applications using asynchronous, event-driven programming and a vast package ecosystem.

---

### **Express.js**  
🌐 Express.js is a fast, minimalist web framework for Node.js. It simplifies routing, middleware integration, and request handling, making it ideal for building RESTful APIs and web applications with ease.

---

### **Mongoose**  
📦 Mongoose is a powerful MongoDB library for Node.js, providing schema-based data modeling. It streamlines interactions with MongoDB, offering validation, query building, and middleware for robust and scalable database solutions.

### **TypeScript**  
💻 TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and modern features. It improves code quality, maintainability, and error detection, making large-scale application development more reliable and developer-friendly.
